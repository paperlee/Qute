        Added a new module property: receiptVerificationSharedSecret (used by the 'verifyReceipt' method)
        Updated the example to support receipt verification (new switch on the UI and new code on the callback method to call 'verifyReceipt' for each transaction)
        Updated the documentation to reflect the changes
        DEPRECATED the 'callback', 'sandbox', and 'sharedSecret' properties of the dictionary object passed to the 'verifyReceipt' method
        Added new 'callback' parameter to the 'verifyReceipt' method
