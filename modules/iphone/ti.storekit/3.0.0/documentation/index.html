<h1>Ti.Storekit Module</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Storekit module allows you access to Apple's in-app purchasing mechanisms.</p>
<h2>How Do I Get Started?</h2>
<p>Read our Wiki page to get started quickly:</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/StoreKit+Module+In-App+Purchase+Testing">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/StoreKit+Module+In-App+Purchase+Testing</a></p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>View the <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Using_Titanium_Modules">Using Titanium Modules</a> document for instructions on getting
started with using this module in your application.</p>
<h2>Accessing the Storekit Module</h2>
<p>To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:</p>
<pre><code>var Storekit = require('ti.storekit');
</code></pre>
<h2>Testing a Store</h2>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>If you are getting this error "The hard-coded bundle version does not match the app's CFBundleShortVersionString." this could be why. 
The <code>bundleVersion</code> and <code>bundleIdentifier</code> properties must be set on the module before calling <code>validateReceipt</code>. These values are used as part of the receipt validation process. In Titanium, when a development build is created to run on "device", a timestamp gets appended to the version number. This is done so that iTunes will see it as a new build and will update the app on the device. Because of this change to the version, when validation occurs the version number does not match and validation fails. To get around this issue: </p>
<ul>
<li>Build the app once through Titanium.</li>
<li>Go to the "build" folder of the app and open the Xcode project with Xcode.</li>
<li>Once the project is open, click on the project on the left in Xcode.</li>
<li>In the center section of Xcode select the "General" tab.</li>
<li>Under "General", make sure that the "Version" is what you expect it to be. </li>
<li>If the version is not what you expect (maybe something like 1.0.0.1382133876099) change it to its correct value (in this case 1.0.0).</li>
<li>Plug in your device.</li>
<li>At the top left of Xcode, select the connected device.</li>
<li>At the top left of Xcode, click "Build and run" (it looks like a play button).</li>
<li>If this was the issue that was causing validation to fail, it should now validate the receipt successfully.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>If you are having trouble testing or some options are not showing up when creating purchases, make sure that you have agreed to all of the contracts under "iTunes Connect" &gt; "Contracts, Tax, and Banking".</p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>Be sure to use a "Development" Provisioning Profile and an "App ID" with "In-App Purchase" enabled.</p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>Storekit does not work in the iOS 7 or iOS 5 Simulator. When running your application in iOS Simulator,
Storekit logs a warning. Testing the store must be done on actual devices.</p>
<h2>Breaking changes in version 3.0.0</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>addTransactionObserver</code> must be called in order for any events to be fired for <code>transactionState</code>, <code>restoredCompletedTransactions</code>, and <code>updatedDownloads</code> event listeners. See the <code>addTransactionObserver</code> documentation for more details.</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for Apple's new receipt structure available in iOS 7.0 and later. To <code>validateReceipt</code>:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain the Apple Inc. root certificate from <a href="http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/">http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/</a></li>
<li>Download the Apple Inc. Root Certificate ( <a href="http://www.apple.com/appleca/AppleIncRootCertificate.cer">http://www.apple.com/appleca/AppleIncRootCertificate.cer</a> )</li>
<li>Add the AppleIncRootCertificate.cer to your app's <code>Resources</code> folder.</li>
<li>Set the <code>bundleVersion</code> and <code>bundleIdentifier</code> properties of the module.</li>
<li>Call <code>validateReceipt()</code>.</li>
<li>If the receipt does not exist (only happens in development), refresh the receipt.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple hosted downloads are supported. The basic steps for downloading hosted content:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a product.</li>
<li>Create Hosted content (guide to <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.storekit/wiki/Creating-App-Store-Hosted-Content">Creating App Store Hosted Content</a>).</li>
<li>Add the content to the product.</li>
<li>Set the <code>autoFinishTransactions</code> property to false.</li>
<li>Purchase the product.</li>
<li>When the state of the <code>transactionState</code> event is <code>TRANSACTION_STATE_PURCHASED</code> and the <code>downloads</code> property of the event exists, start the downloads.</li>
<li>When the download completes, finish the transaction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passing arguments to the <code>purchase</code> function individually is DEPRECATED, pass them as a dictionary instead.</p>
</li>
<li>Transaction state constants <code>PURCHASING</code>, <code>PURCHASED</code>, <code>FAILED</code>, and <code>RESTORED</code> have been DEPRECATED in favor of <code>TRANSACTION_STATE_PURCHASING</code>, <code>TRANSACTION_STATE_PURCHASED</code>, <code>TRANSACTION_STATE_FAILED</code>, and <code>TRANSACTION_STATE_RESTORED</code>.</li>
<li>Some event properties in the <code>transactionState</code> event have been DEPRECATED. See the <code>transactionState</code> event documentation for more details.</li>
<li>An alert dialog warning will now be shown when run in the simulator. This dialog can be disabled by setting the <code>suppressSimulatorWarning</code> property on the module to true.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Apple Hosted Purchases</h3>
<p>Apple hosted in app purchases can now be downloaded. This is supported in iOS 6.0 and later.  Must be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/13_ManagingIn-AppPurchases/ManagingIn-AppPurchases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH4-SW37">Non-Consumable Purchases</a> to be hosted by Apple. This guide will assist with <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.storekit/wiki/Creating-App-Store-Hosted-Content">Creating App Store Hosted Content</a>.</p>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>This module uses open source code for parsing and validating the receipt. It is recommended by Apple that users not use common code to do this as it will make it easier to crack your app. Please make appropriate changes to the receipt verification code in the module to make your implementation unique and less vulnerable to attack. We cannot do this for you or offer recommendations regarding how it should be done due to aforementioned reasons.</p>
<h2>Breaking Changes in version 2.0.0</h2>
<p>It was previously possible for a transaction to complete after the application had been moved to the background due to the app store
needing to obtain information from the user. Although your application may have received a <em>FAILED</em> notification when your application
was moved to the background, your application would not have received a <em>PURCHASED</em> notification if the user completed the transaction from
the app store. In order to support this situation, purchase notifications are now sent to your application as an event rather than through
a callback.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of this module (prior to version 2.0.0) you should be
aware of the following breaking changes to the API:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>purchase</em> function no longer returns a Ti.Storekit.Payment object.</li>
<li>The <em>callback</em> parameter has been removed from the <em>purchase</em> function. You must now register an event listener 
for the <em>transactionState</em> event to receive notification of FAILED and PURCHASED transaction events.</li>
<li>The <em>payment</em> property is no longer returned as part of the transaction complete notification.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deprecated since version 1.6.0</h2>
<p>The <em>verifyReceipt</em> function has been updated to better support receipt verification with Apple. As a result, the following
changes have been made to the <em>verifyReceipt</em> function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the callback in the argument dictionary has been DEPRECATED. Pass the callback as the 2nd parameter to <em>verifyReceipt</em>.</li>
<li>Setting the sandbox property in the argument dictionary has been DEPRECATED. Use the 'receiptVerificationSandbox' property for the module.</li>
<li>Setting the sharedSecret property in the argument dictionary has been DEPRECATED. Use the 'receiptVerificationSharedSecret' property for the module.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<h3>addTransactionObserver()</h3>
<p>Start accepting events that will trigger event listeners for <code>transactionState</code>, <code>restoredCompletedTransactions</code>, and <code>updatedDownloads</code>. </p>
<p>This should be called early in the app startup, but only after event listeners for the above events are added. If this function is not called, the above events will not fire. Calling this function before adding the event listeners will tell the store kit that you are accepting events, but the events may be lost if they happen before the event listener is there to catch them.</p>
<h3>removeTransactionObserver()</h3>
<p>Stop accepting events that will trigger event listeners for <code>transactionState</code>, <code>restoredCompletedTransactions</code>, and <code>updatedDownloads</code>.</p>
<p>This will be called for you automatically when the app is shut down.</p>
<h3>requestProducts(ids[array], callback(e){})</h3>
<p>Requests to see if products identified by the strings in the <em>id</em> array are available.
The <em>callback</em> function is called upon completion of the request, with the following event
information:</p>
<ul>
<li>success[boolean]: Whether or not the request succeeded</li>
<li>message[string]: If the request failed, the reason why</li>
<li>products[array]: An array of <em><a href="product.html">Ti.Storekit.Product</a></em> objects which represent the valid products retrieved</li>
<li>invalid[array]: An array of identifiers passed to the request that did not correspond to a product ID. Only present when at least one requested product is invalid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Returns a <em><a href="productRequest.html">Ti.Storekit.ProductRequest</a></em> object.</p>
<h3>purchase(args[object])</h3>
<p>Purchases the <em><a href="product.html">Ti.Storekit.Product</a></em> object passed to it.  The <em>transactionState</em> event is fired when
the purchase request's state changes.</p>
<p>Takes one argument, a dictionary with the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>product[<em><a href="product.html">Ti.Storekit.Product</a></em>]: The product to be purchased.</li>
<li>quantity[number] (optional): The quantity to be purchased. Has a default value of 1.</li>
<li>applicationUsername[string] (optional): An opaque identifier for the user's account on your system. Used by Apple to detect irregular activity. Should hash the username before setting. Available in iOS 7.0 and later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DEPRECATED:</strong> Passing separate arguments <code>purchase(object, quantity[int, optional])</code>. Use a dictionary of arguments as seen above.</p>
<h3>verifyReceipt(args[object], callback(e){})</h3>
<p><strong>DEPRECATED:</strong> Use <code>validateReceipt</code> in iOS 7.0 and later.</p>
<p>Verifies that a receipt passed from a Storekit purchase or restored transaction is valid. Note that you rarely need to do this
step in-app. It is much more likely that you would want to do this step on your own server to confirm from Apple that a
purchase is legitimate.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> There is a vulnerability in iOS 5.1 and earlier related to receipt validation. Your application
should perform the additional step of verifying that the receipt you received from Store Kit came from Apple. This is
particularly important when your application relies on a separate server to provide subscriptions, services, or downloadable
content. Verifying receipts on your server ensures that requests from your application are valid.</p>
<p>Takes one argument, a dictionary with the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>identifier[string]: The transaction identifier</li>
<li>receipt[blob]: A receipt retrieved from a call to Ti.Storekit.purchase's callback evt.receipt.</li>
<li>quantity[int]: The number of items purchased</li>
<li>productIdentifier[string]: The product's identifier in the in-app store</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>callback</em> function is called when the verification request completes, with the following event information:</p>
<ul>
<li>success[boolean]: Whether or not the request succeeded</li>
<li>valid[boolean]: Whether or not the receipt is valid</li>
<li>message[string]: If <em>success</em> or <em>valid</em> is false, the error message</li>
<li>identifier[string]: The transaction identifier</li>
<li>receipt[object]: A blob of type "text/json" which contains the receipt information for the purchase.</li>
<li>quantity[int]: The number of items purchased</li>
<li>productIdentifier[string]: The product's identifier in the in-app store.</li>
</ul>
<p>Returns a <em><a href="receiptRequest.html">Ti.Storekit.ReceiptRequest</a></em> object.</p>
<h3>validateReceipt()</h3>
<p>Checks if the receipt on the device is valid. <code>validateReceipt</code> is just as secure as <code>verifyReceipt</code>, and it is done entirely on the device. Returns true if the receipt is valid or false if it is not. Throws an error if the receipt does not exist, use <code>receiptExists</code> to avoid this error.</p>
<p>The <code>bundleVersion</code> and <code>bundleIdentifier</code> properties must be set on the module before calling <code>validateReceipt</code>. Do not pull these values from the app, they should be hard coded for security reasons.</p>
<p>The Apple Inc. Root Certificate is required to validate receipts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain the Apple Inc. root certificate from <a href="http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/">http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/</a></li>
<li>Download the Apple Inc. Root Certificate ( <a href="http://www.apple.com/appleca/AppleIncRootCertificate.cer">http://www.apple.com/appleca/AppleIncRootCertificate.cer</a> )</li>
<li>Add the AppleIncRootCertificate.cer to your app's <code>Resources</code> folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Returns a boolean.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Available in iOS 7.0 and later.</p>
<h3>refreshReceipt(args[object], callback(e){})</h3>
<p>Allows an app to refresh its receipt. With this API, the app can request a new receipt if the receipt is invalid or missing. In the sandbox environment, you can request a receipt with any combination of properties to test the state transitions related to Volume Purchase Plan receipts.</p>
<p>The args object can contain the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>expired[number]: A number interpreted as a Boolean value, indicating whether the receipt is expired.</li>
<li>revoked[number]: A number interpreted as a Boolean value, indicating whether the receipt has been revoked.</li>
<li>vpp[number]: A number interpreted as a Boolean value, indicating whether the receipt is is a Volume Purchase Plan receipt.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>callback</em> function is called when the refresh request completes, with the following event information:</p>
<ul>
<li>success[boolean]: Boolean indicating if the request was successful or not.</li>
<li>error[string]: Error message if success is false.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information checkout Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StoreKit/Reference/SKReceiptRefreshRequest_ClassRef/SKReceiptRefreshRequest.html">SKReceiptRefreshRequest Documentation</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Available in iOS 7.0 and later.</p>
<h3>restoreCompletedTransactions()</h3>
<p>Asks the payment queue to restore previously completed purchases. The <em>restoredCompletedTransactions</em> event is fired when
the transactions have been restored. </p>
<p>Note that calling this may ask the user to authenticate!
It is recommended that you give the user the option to restore their past purchases via a button, and invoke this method
only after the user touches it.</p>
<h3>startDownloads(args[object])</h3>
<p>Adds a set of downloads to the download list.</p>
<p>In order for a download object to be queued, it must be associated with a transaction that has been successfully purchased, but not yet finished.</p>
<p>Takes one argument, a dictionary with the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>downloads[array&lt;<a href="download.html">Ti.Storekit.Download</a>&gt;]: An array of download objects to begin downloading.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>autoFinishTransactions</code> must be false for download functionality to work.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Available in iOS 6.0 and later.</p>
<h3>cancelDownloads(args[object])</h3>
<p>Removes a set of downloads from the download list.</p>
<p>Takes one argument, a dictionary with the following values:</p>
